NOTES on PROJECT 6:
==================
-There are 256 cases (2^8) per cell/cube.
-Cases can have up to 16 points.
-Points may be repeated to add up to a number divisible by 3
	{0, 3, 8, 0, 1, 2, etc}
-For instance, one case may be:
	{0, 3, 8, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1}
	E0 -> E3 -> E8 (makes one triangle)
	
- I think what's going on is:
Hank's case surrounds V0
-the next v1
-the next v2
My case covers v3
